# Hard Reset device analysis

You can view the results here : https://toufikswar.github.io/hard-reset-analysis/

This project consists a data pipeline in R in order to understand and find root causes of a rise in hard resets within a group of devices.

I try to understand the occurences of hard resets linking into different models, locations, viewing timeseries and trying to find correlation between hard reset
and certain install/uninstall operations.
